## Education
**Computer Engineering Doctor of Philosophy - PhD- Suleyman Demirel University** Ankara, Türkiye

In my PhD research, I focused on advancing AI techniques for group-based pathfinding in 3D terrains, addressing the challenges of navigation across complex environments. The study explored novel algorithms that extend the traditional A* pathfinding approach, specifically designed for 3D terrain applications. I utilized the Unity3D game engine to simulate realistic scenarios, integrating slope angles, obstacle avoidance, and group dynamics into the pathfinding process. The research tackled key issues such as group cohesion, collision avoidance between individuals, and optimal traversal strategies in terrains with varying topography. The proposed next-generation pathfinding algorithms demonstrated improvements in efficiency and adaptability in navigating uneven terrain, contributing to the development of more sophisticated AI-driven navigation systems for group-based movements in 3D environments.
