### AI Engineer | Software Developer | Specialized in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, and LLMs | Python, Java, JavaScript, C++, C# | Experience in Jetson and TPUs | React, Node.js, Spring Boot, .NET Core

## About
I am an experienced Full-Stack Software and AI Engineer with a deep focus on building complex AI applications and large-scale systems. With 15 years of experience, I have led the development of end-to-end AI-powered applications across various industries, specializing in computer vision, large language models (LLM), and edge computing on devices such as Jetson, TPU, and Raspberry Pi.

I have also architected and deployed full-stack solutions from scratch, leveraging React, Node.js, Spring Boot, and .NET Core for robust, scalable systems. Whether working on camera security systems, face recognition apps, object detection solutions, or speech-to-text and text-to-speech applications, I have consistently delivered impactful AI solutions in real-time and resource-constrained environments.

## Projects
### Smart Security AI
A comprehensive camera-based security solution that integrates multiple advanced AI capabilities:

Technologies & Techniques: 
Uses facial recognition for identity verification and access control, object detection for restricted area monitoring, fire and smoke detection to reduce false alarms, and license plate recognition for vehicle tracking.
Applications: Deployed in large-scale security environments such as airports, industrial zones, and smart cities. The solution is enhanced with custom object detection, e.g., detecting weapons, helmets, or masks in real-time, integrating deep learning models and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for accurate detection.
